# HairPhysicsSimulation


Running example
This an adaptation of the cloth Three.js example for hair. It uses many of the techniques outlined in Nvidia's Hair demos. The program should run as is. However, In order to run the application you will need to setup a local server. There are many ways to do this but the eaiest is probably to use Python. Simply put "python -m SimpleHTTPServer", open a browser and go to "http://localhost:8000/". Assuming you are using chrome, or another webgl enabled browser it should run.

The Hair.js and HairPhysicsSimulation.html were the two files coded by me, the rest are all part of the Three.js framework.
